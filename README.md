**Project Title: Sales Forecasting for Rossmann Drug Stores**

***Overview***
Rossmann, a multinational company, operates a vast network of over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. The company faces the challenge of predicting daily sales for a period of up to six weeks in advance. Accurate sales forecasting is essential for effective inventory management and operational efficiency.

***Problem Statement***
Store managers at Rossmann encounter difficulties in predicting daily sales due to various influencing factors, including:
+ Promotions
+ Competition
+ School and state holidays
+ Seasonality
+ Locality
Given these variables, the accuracy of sales predictions can vary significantly among store managers, which can lead to overstocking or stockouts.

***Objective***
The primary objective of this project is to develop a forecasting model that accurately predicts daily sales while considering the impact of competition and other influencing factors.
